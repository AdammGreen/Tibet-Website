# Tibet-Website
A website about Tibet that I created using HTML and CSS which was written in visual studio code.

<b>Very Important! :<size:20></b> If you want to see the webpage's like a normal website in github. Click on a page (e.g Dalai Lama) in github and then press raw code in top right corner. Now your url will look something like this 
<b>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdammGreen/Tibet-Website/main/Infosproject_html/Dalailama.html</b>

Change the "raw.githubusercontent" to "raw.githubhack" and press enter

Viola! You can now see the pages.
